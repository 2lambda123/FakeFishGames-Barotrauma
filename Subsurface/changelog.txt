	- Submarine files can be "merged", i.e. submarines can consist of multiple separate parts which can
	be docked into each other
	- the multiplayer mode has a "respawn shuttle" which transports respawned players from the entrance
	to the main submarine
	- parts of the submarine and characters inside them can be left behind in the single player mode
	(and later salvaged if you wish to do so)

Multiplayer:
	- fixed a bunch of bugs that caused entity IDs not to match between the clients and the server (which
	caused severe syncing issues)
	- fixed monster inventory syncing (i.e. husk inventory syncing)
	- fixed server description box not being synced with clients
	- search bar for server logs
	- more server options
	- fixed the occasional "queue empty" error messages when attempting to send submarine files to players

	(custom subs may need some modifications to get the top speeds of the smaller/larger subs back to a
	steerable level)
	- changes to depth damage logic: structures with more health need more pressure before they start taking
	damage (i.e. submarines with thicker walls and no windows can go deeper)

Misc:
	- stunned characters can't move items in their inventory
	- characters can run while grabbing/dragging someone
	- fixed a bug that made it impossible to spawn characters through the console in the Linux version
