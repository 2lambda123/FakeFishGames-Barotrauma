---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.2
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Multiplayer:
	- major optimization and much better lag compensation
	- tons of bugfixes that should fix most of the syncing issues
	- admins can play on their own server without launching another instance of the game
	- setting the job preferences actually does something now
	- reconnecting to a server if the connection is temporarily lost works much better now
	- proper error messages if UPnP port forwarding fails

Items:
	- security guard gear: ballistic vest, helmet & stun baton
	- wifi components that can be used for transmitting signals between devices
	- wall labels with a configurable text
	- a bunch of new sprites and sounds
	- wearing a diving suit slows the characters down
	- supercapacitors
	- attempting to fire the railgun when there are no shells loaded doesn't consume power anymore

Submarine:
	- improved version of Aegir
	- a new submarine, "Vellamo"
	- nuclear reactors overheat much more slowly and there are warning signals for overheating and a remote
	shutdown button in both of the default subs
	- ambient sounds change according to the speed of the sub
	- fixed parts of the submarine getting stuck in the level on collision

Crew:
	- aiming underwater is much easier
	- improved humanoid animations
	- stunned/dead characters can be dragged
	- all characters can now use plasma cutters and welders regardless of their skills, but insufficient
	skill level will make them flicker and work much less efficiently
	- same for the harpoon gun, anyone can shoot but lower levels will make the gun less accurate
	- rewiring devices may cause electric shocks if the electrical engineering level is too low

Creatures:
	- some random "prop fish" swimming in the background
	- a new hostile creature

Misc:
	- a tutorial going through all the basic tasks and game mechanics (more in-depth tutorials will be
	added in future versions, including one for making custom subs)
	- an auto-updater in the launcher
	- the game generates a detailed report if it crashes
	- physics optimization (i.e. using simplified physics & animation for off-screen characters and 
	disabling them entirely if they're far enough)
	- lighting optimization (caching the lights/shadows if a light source hasn't moved instead of 
	recalculating them every frame)
	- two new background music tracks
	- better looking explosions
	- better looking water particle effects
	- minor UI improvements
	- better UI scaling on different resolutions
	- health/oxygen bar improvements and status icons for bleeding and water pressure	
	- gap-hull connections are visible in the sub editor
	- pumps don't have to be manually connected to a hull in the editor anymore, they automatically
	empty/fill the hull they're inside

	a harpoon, not the other way around)
