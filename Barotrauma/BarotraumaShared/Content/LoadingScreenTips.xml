  <!-- Gameplay tips -->
  <Tip text="You will not paid for delivering cargo if any of the cargo goes missing or gets damaged during the transport."/>
  <Tip text="Generating more power than the devices in the submarine are consuming may damage junction boxes or cause fires."/>
  <Tip text="Junction boxes and other electrical devices may get damaged if they stay submerged too long."/>  
  <Tip text="Breaking down alien artifacts in a deconstructor may provide you with exotic raw materials."/>
  <Tip text="Special caution must be taken when bringing alien artifacts on board the submarine."/>
  <Tip text="The cephalopod-like watchers are generally docile, but may attack when provoked."/>
  <Tip text="Most submarines are equipped with stationary batteries that can be used as a temporary source of backup power in the case of a reactor failure."/>
  <Tip text="Cannibalistic behavior is very common among crawlers. Killing one in a swarm may distract the rest as they enter into a feeding frenzy."/>
  <Tip text="Mantises can easily tear their way through metal doors with their sharp claws."/>
  <Tip text="The so-called husk parasites slowly take over and consume the body of their host, eventually turning them into nothing but an empty exoskeleton controlled by the parasite."/>
  <Tip text="Many creatures on Europa are protected by a strong shell, and are difficult to damage with conventional weapons unless hit from below."/>
  <Tip text="Railgun shells and depth charges include a compartment that can hold additional explosives."/>
  <Tip text="Loud devices and sonar pings may alert nearby creatures."/>
  <Tip text="Passive sonar can be used to detect nearby sound sources without attracting unwanted attention. You can also get a rough idea of your surroundings based on the sounds reflected from the ice walls."/>
  <Tip text="There are many ways to get past locked doors, including forcing them open with a crowbar or rewiring them to a button you have access to."/>
  <Tip text="Stationary batteries are equipped with docks that can be used to charge battery cells."/>
  <Tip text="Oxygen generators are equipped with docks that can be used to refill oxygen tanks."/>
  <Tip text="Performing CPR without adequate medical skills may cause internal damage to the patient."/>
  <Tip text="Attempting to rewire powered devices without adequate electrical engineering skills may get you electrocuted."/>
  <Tip text="When using a diving mask, be careful not to mix up welding fuel tanks and oxygen tanks."/>
  <Tip text="In the event of a fire, burns are not the only thing to watch out for - fires can quickly consume all the oxygen inside the submarine."/>
  <Tip text="Traversing the so-called Hydrothermal Wastes requires special caution. Not only are they abundant in wildlife, but the water currents caused by geothermal activity make navigation even more hazardous."/>
  <Tip text="Some of the sessile lifeforms in Europa emit low-frequency sounds that may disrupt the submarine's sonar."/>

  <!-- Lore -->
  <Tip text="The radiation belts around Jupiter make it impracticable to establish permanent settlements above Europa's surface, and as such almost all Europan outposts are located below its icy crust."/>
  <Tip text="The dynamics of Europa's underwater ecosystem are still not fully understood, but it is believed that the base of the food chain is mostly formed by chemosynthetic bacteria."/>
  <Tip text="The Europa Coalition started off as a trade and co-operation agreement between the two largest Europan settlements and a handful of private paramilitary groups, but gradually grew to become what is essentially the Europan government."/>
  <Tip text="The much-ridiculed initiative to help submariners cope in a high-stress environment by including professional entertainers in the crews was promptly deemed a failure and discontinued."/>
